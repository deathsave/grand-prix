====================

Modes
-----

### Pace Lap

This is effectively the "base mode".

TODO: Define base-scoring...


### Green-flag

The race is underway. This is the primary left-flipper shot. The left gate is
held open allowing a counter-clockwise orbit. Bottom-most 3 inserts on
South-East chain keep track of successful orbits.

* Mode activated when one of the 2 pairs of drop targets go down.
* 3 orbits activates Pit Row.

TODO: Define scoring bonuses during...


### Find your Groove

Top-most 10 inserts in North-West chain... spells out G-R-O-O-V-E-L-I-N-E.

TODO: Define scoring bonuses during...


### Flat-tire

Top-most 4 inserts in South-East chain... spells out F-L-A-T. Entering left
"pot hole" 4 times causes a flat tire. No modes are advanced and scoring is
back to "base scoring" until player successfully makes it to Pit Row.


### Pit Row

Primary right flipper shot. Player needs to pit... either to lock a ball or
fix a flat.

* Active after 3 "Laps" or when "FLAT".
* Left-arrow indicator flashes.
* **DOES NOT LOCK A BALL DURING FLAT MODE**!

After a successful "pit stop", ball is auto-kicked after a couple seconds
of "pit sounds". If this is the 3rd locked ball, Split-time Multiball is
activated. Otherwise, gameplay returns to Pace Lap mode.


### Lapped - "She's going the distance".

Player knocks down all 4 drop targets during a single ball.


### BOOST Bonus - "She's going for speed".

When fully lit, lamps blink and the incrementing switches award 10x for some
TBD number of seconds (30?).

* Awarded at end of ball (flat value * multiplier)
* Pulses chimebox 5 times in 0.5s intervals equal to lit letters (turning
them off with each group (similar to original spec)
* Entering left-hole during play:
  * Collects a TBD scoring value.
  * Additionally increments the multiplier IF "BOOST" inserts fully lit.


### Winner's Circle Multi-ball (2-ball) - "She's all alone, all alone,
all alone".

Left and right lights by the top-hole indicate state towards achieving.
Player must:

* Complete spelling of GROOVELINE to light left
* Knock down *ALL* 4** Drop Targets to light right
* Enter the top-hole while both indicators are lit

Top-hole will lock ball and autokicker will launch 2 more.


### Split-time Multiball (3-ball) - "In a time of need".

20 second or so, time-limited multi-ball. Activated when 3rd ball is
soft-locked. Entering pit row extends time by 5s or so.


### Red-flag Multiball (4-ball)

The Wizard Mode (if we get to it). Player must complete *4 major obectives*
indicated by the 4 lights in the center of the playfield:

* Knock down both pairs of drop-targets
* Collect *3 Complete* BOOST Bonuses (end of ball OR during play)
* Begin Winner's Circle Multiball
