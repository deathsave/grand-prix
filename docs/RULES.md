Modes
-----

### Pace Lap

This is effectively the "base mode".


### Green-flag

The race is underway. This is the primary left-flipper shot. Mode is activated
when one of the 2 pairs of drop targets go down. Bottom-most 3 inserts on
South-West chain keep track of successful orbits. 3 orbits activates Pit Row.


### Find your Groove

Top-most 6 inserts in South-East chain... spells out G-R-O-O-V-E.


### Flat-tire

Top-most 4 inserts in South-West chain... spells out F-L-A-T. Hitting
standing target 4 times causes a flat tire. Nothing advances/scores until
player successful makes it to Pit Row.


### Pit Row

Primary right flipper shot when left-arrow indicator is flashing. Player
needs to pit... either to lock a ball or fix a flat.
**DOES NOT LOCK A BALL DURING FLAT MODE**!

Ball is auto-kicked after a couple seconds of "pit sounds". If this is the
3rd locked ball, Split-time Multiball is activated. Otherwise, gameplay
returns to Pace Lap mode.


### Winner's Circle

The top-hole, should do several things depending on the active mode. TBD.


### Yellow-flag Bonus

At end of ball, pulse chimebox 5 times in 0.5s intervals equal to bonus
level. Will do more... TBD


### Split-time Multiball

20 second or so time-limited multi-ball. Activated when 3rd ball is
soft-locked. Entering pit row extends time by 5s or so.


### Red-flag Multiball

Steve was thinking some sort of last-chance thing if I recall correctly, TBD.


### White-flag Multiball

The Wizard Mode if we get to it.
